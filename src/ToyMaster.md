Or ask your clients to manually install them. Else they will **crash** in 100% cases.

In a free, add-on mod for Killing Floor, created by David Hensley (with help from Killing Floor originator, [*Alex Quick*](./tech/Links.md#KF_Alex)), you can fight off the bizarre and warped toys of someone's nightmare, that are hell-bent on finishing you off. All the standard Zeds are replaced with evil toys, set in the Devil's Dollhouse map Â©

Cmdline for dedicated servers:

```bash
Game=KFCharPuppets.TOYGameInfo
